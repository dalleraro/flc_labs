The program is behaving as expected with the provided input file, and the output is coherent with the one in the example.

However when I tried to modify the CONFIGURE instruction in the input file to make it consider
only one of the quantities (eg. CONFIGURE TEMPERATURE 20;), 
I realized that I forgot to consider the S symbol (ie ";") in that version of the instruction.

No other changes were made to the code presented during the test.
